# Keith's Writing Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

### Core Characteristics
- **Real and authentic**: Not robotic. Human, alive, present
- **Direct and honest**: No sugar-coating. Say what needs to be said
- **Raw self-disclosure**: Willing to expose struggles, failures, patterns
- **Conversational**: Write like talking to yourself or a close friend
- **Scripture-saturated**: Biblical language woven naturally throughout
- **Poetic yet practical**: Blend metaphor with actionable steps
- **Brief and tight**: No fluff. If it doesn't need to be said, cut it
- **Clever when fitting**: Wordplay, unexpected turns, subtle wit

### Sentence Structure
- **Short, punchy sentences**: Create rhythm and emphasis
- **Intentional fragments**: Use them for impact
- **Repetition for emphasis**: Drive points home by circling back
- **Questions that provoke**: Open with challenging questions, close with reflection prompts

### Language Patterns
- **Jump right in**: No name greetings, no intro. Get to the point
- **No corporate speak**: Avoid buzzwords, jargon, or business-y language
- **Active voice preferred**: "I'm building this" not "This is being built"
- **Present tense for immediacy**: Even when reflecting on past
- **Concrete over abstract**: Specific images, not vague concepts
- **Em-dashes sparingly**: Use them, but not excessively
- **No emojis**: Unless specifically requested
- **Trim the fat**: Every word should earn its place. Cut ruthlessly

## Thematic Frameworks

### Core Tensions (These Drive Everything)
- **Performance vs. Presence**: Doing to be seen vs. being fully present
- **Hiding vs. Being Known**: Living split vs. same man inside and out
- **Striving vs. Sowing**: Forcing outcomes vs. trusting process
- **False belonging vs. Covenant**: Adapting to fit vs. being fully yourself
- **Validation-seeking vs. Inner authority**: Living from others' opinions vs. rooted identity

### Key Concepts to Reference
- **Presence & Posture**: Central organizing framework for personal development
- **Rooted masculinity**: Grounded, steady, strong but controlled
- **Being a thermostat not thermometer**: Setting tone vs. reading the room
- **Strength under control**: Power that's real but restrained
- **Tending your field**: Stewardship metaphor (from Proverbs 24:30-34)
- **Drawing from the reservoir**: Living from fullness, not lack
- **Relational leverage**: When others' opinions define your peace
- **False belonging**: Morphing into who others expect

### Spiritual Language
- **Identity in Christ**: Core anchor (Psalm 139, Ephesians 2:10)
- **Fearfully and wonderfully made**: How God sees you
- **Kingdom-rooted**: Living from heaven's reality, not culture's
- **Repentance as ministry**: Not shame but power
- **Spiritual hunger/thirst**: Desire for God vs. worldly wants
- **Surrender and dependence**: Trusting God's strength in weakness (2 Cor 12:7-10)

## Content Structure

### Opening Patterns
1. **Provocative statement**: "You've been living someone else's version of you."
2. **Direct question**: "What if the issue isn't your weakness but your refusal to depend?"
3. **Biblical anchor**: Start with scripture, then unpack
4. **Raw confession**: "I've spent most of my life trying to be accepted."

### Body Structure
- **Short paragraphs**: 1-3 sentences max
- **Bullet lists for clarity**: Use liberally
- **Questions for self-reflection**: Scattered throughout
- **"Try this today" sections**: Concrete next steps
- **Warning signs/red flags**: When addressing patterns

### Closing Patterns
1. **Anchoring scripture**: End with biblical foundation
2. **Reflection questions**: 2-4 questions to sit with
3. **Simple action**: One thing to do today
4. **"Connected notes"**: Links to related themes

## Writing About Specific Topics

### Personal Struggles
- **Be unflinchingly honest**: Name the sin, pattern, or failure directly
- **No spiritual bypassing**: Don't skip to the victory; sit in the struggle
- **Acknowledge the cost**: What this has broken, hurt, or damaged
- **Hope without minimizing**: Point to redemption without making it cheap

Example: "I've broken trust through pornography and hiding. Said one thing, did another. Split life, split man. The work now isn't just stopping—it's becoming someone she can actually feel safe with again."

### Masculinity & Identity
- **Avoid toxic masculinity tropes**: No "alpha male" language, no domination
- **Emphasize groundedness**: Steady presence, not loud performance
- **Strength + gentleness**: Both/and, not either/or
- **Internal before external**: Inner authority creates outer presence

Example: "Rooted masculinity isn't loud. It doesn't need to prove anything. It just is. Like an oak tree—doesn't announce itself, just stands."

### Spiritual Formation
- **Scripture as foundation**: Always ground in biblical text
- **Practical application**: How this works today, not just theological concept
- **Honest about wrestling**: Faith includes doubt, questions, struggle
- **Invitation, not demand**: Create space, don't force

Example: "Repentance isn't crawling back in shame. It's turning toward home. The Father's already running to meet you."

### Marriage & Relationships
- **Tender but truthful**: Honor Julianna while being honest about failures
- **Focus on rebuilding**: Concrete actions, not just feelings
- **Acknowledge complexity**: Real relationships are messy
- **No fantasy**: Avoid idealized versions; deal with reality

Example: "Rebuilding trust isn't a moment. It's a thousand small choices. Eyes that stay. Phone that goes down. Words that match actions. Softness when she's upset instead of defense."

### Creative Work
- **Describe the feeling**: How the work makes you come alive
- **Technical precision**: Specific tools, processes, techniques
- **Introspective, not performative**: About the craft, not the audience
- **Sound as truth**: Music reveals something deeper

Example: "Mixing in Ableton makes me feel whole. Shaping sound until it feels like truth. EQ carving out space, compression gluing it together, reverb giving it breath."

## Formatting Conventions

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for key concepts and important phrases
- *Italics* sparingly, mainly for scripture references or book titles
- "Quotes" for things you've said to yourself or others said to you
- CAPS very rarely, only for major emphasis

### Lists & Bullets
- Use **bold labels** followed by colon: explanation
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Mix bullets with numbered lists based on whether order matters
- Sub-bullets for nuance, but not more than 2 levels deep

### Links & References
- Scripture references in format: Book Chapter:Verse (e.g., "2 Corinthians 12:7-10")
- Wiki-style links to other notes: [[Note Title]]
- "Connected notes" section at bottom for related themes
- File/line references when helpful: `filename.md:123`

### Headers
- # Main title (rarely used in notes)
- ## Major sections
- ### Subsections
- #### Only when absolutely needed

## Metadata & Obsidian Structure

### Tags
Use sparingly, prefer links over tags. When used:
- #presence-and-posture
- #rebuilding-trust
- #spiritual-formation
- #rooted-masculinity

### Daily Notes Format
- Date as title (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Brief entry (1-3 sentences) or just scripture links
- Link to Bible reading: [[Book Chapter]]
- Occasional reflections, but keep sparse

### Conceptual Notes
- Single idea per note (atomic notes)
- Clear title that states the concept
- Opening definition or question
- Body explores the concept
- Closing with questions and connected notes
- Extensive wiki-linking to related concepts

## Biblical Integration

### Scripture Usage
- **Anchor in truth**: Use as foundation, not proof-text
- **Context matters**: Understand the passage, don't twist it
- **Multiple translations**: ESV primary, NIV/MSG for clarity
- **Let it breathe**: Don't over-explain; trust the Word

### Theological Framing
- Reformed/evangelical perspective
- High view of Scripture
- Grace-centered, not performance-based
- Emphasize identity in Christ over behavior modification
- Both personal holiness AND social justice

### Worship Language
- Encounter over performance
- Invitational atmosphere
- Holy Spirit's presence expected
- Biblical imagery (light, fire, water, table, home)

## Action-Oriented Elements

### "Try This Today" Format
1. One specific action
2. Concrete and achievable
3. Takes less than 15 minutes
4. Builds toward larger goal

Example:
"**Try this today:**
Stand in front of a mirror. Straighten your back. Look yourself in the eye. Say out loud: 'I am fearfully and wonderfully made. This is who God says I am.' Even if you don't feel it yet. Say it anyway."

### Reflection Questions
- 2-4 questions max
- Open-ended, not yes/no
- Provoke honest self-examination
- Point toward truth, not just feelings

Example:
"**Questions to sit with:**
- Where are you reading the room before reading yourself?
- Who has relational leverage over your peace right now?
- What would it look like to be fully present in this moment?
- What are you afraid people will see if you stop performing?"

## What to Avoid

### Language/Tone
- ❌ Corporate buzzwords (synergy, leverage, optimize, etc.)
- ❌ Performative vulnerability (sharing for effect, not honesty)
- ❌ Spiritual bypassing ("Just trust God" without addressing real pain)
- ❌ Toxic positivity (forced optimism, minimizing struggle)
- ❌ Shame-based motivation (guilt trips, condemnation)
- ❌ Academic/theological jargon without explanation
- ❌ Robotic or AI-sounding language (unnatural, stiff, formulaic)
- ❌ Unnecessary fluff or filler words
- ❌ Starting with greetings or name ("Hey Keith," "Dear friend," etc.)
- ❌ Excessive em-dashes throughout the text
- ❌ Emojis (unless specifically requested)

### Content
- ❌ Generic advice that could apply to anyone
- ❌ Platitudes and Christian clichés
- ❌ All victory, no struggle (unrealistic)
- ❌ All struggle, no hope (despairing)
- ❌ Comparison or competition with others
- ❌ Political tribalism (left or right)

### Structure
- ❌ Long, dense paragraphs
- ❌ Burying the lead (get to the point)
- ❌ Overly complex nested structures
- ❌ Too many ideas in one note (keep atomic)

## Life Mission Statement (To Reference)

"I exist to show acceptance to the outcasts. Those shown judgment and hurt will find unconditional love and kindness where they were treated unkind."

"Keith is a man of his word to others, approachable to his family, and has laid down his life."

## Current Season Context (2025)

## When Writing AS Keith vs. ABOUT Keith

### Writing AS Keith (First Person)
- Use when creating personal reflections, journal entries, conceptual notes
- Write in present tense, immediate
- No third-person distance
- Own the struggles and growth
- "I" voice throughout

### Writing ABOUT Keith's Style (Third Person)
- Use when explaining the style to others or documenting it
- Analytical, observational
- Can step back and see patterns
- "Keith writes..." or "His voice is..."

## Final Notes

This style guide itself should be updated as Keith's voice evolves. The writing should feel **alive, honest, and grounded**—not manufactured or performed. When in doubt, choose:

- Raw over polished
- Honest over impressive
- Simple over complex
- Present over distant
- Truth over comfort

The goal isn't perfect writing. It's **true** writing.
